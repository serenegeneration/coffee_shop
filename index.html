<h1>welcome to cofair</h1>
</div>
<div id="main">
    <p>welcome to cofair where you will find the best coffee and sweet treats.
    why i hear you ask? because here at cofair we have coffee sourced across the world.
    we decided that relying on one farm would be unwise due to possible disease.
    and besides the land needs time to recover in order for the best produce.</p>
</div>
    <div id="main">
    <p>also here at cofair we pay our farmers a fair wage so even in case of crop disease
    they can recover their land with no stress.
    happy land. happy us. happy farmers. with all this joy it's no wonder
    our coffee is the best in the world.</p>
